Title: Truth Table Logic Optimizer
Date: 2016-05-06
Description: Access to powerful logic minimization algorithms and data structures that operate on a sum-of-products truth table.  The core algorithms are built on Espresso Version 2.3 developed at UC Berkeley for digital logic synthesis purposes.  Enhancements have been made to integrate within the R framework and support additional logic optimization use cases such as those needed by Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and Genetic Programming.  There are no expressed or implied warranties.
